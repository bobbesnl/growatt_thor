# Growatt THOR EV Charger – Home Assistant Integration (OCPP)

⚠️ **ALPHA VERSION – DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

This integration is under heavy development.
Expect breaking changes and incomplete functionality.




⚡ **Unofficial Home Assistant integration for the Growatt THOR EV charger**  
This project allows you to connect a Growatt THOR EV charger **directly to Home Assistant** using **OCPP 1.6 over WebSocket**, without relying on the Growatt cloud.

> ⚠️ This is an **unofficial community project**. Growatt is not affiliated in any way.

## What does this integration do?

This integration runs a **local OCPP server inside Home Assistant**.  
The Growatt THOR charger connects directly to Home Assistant instead of the Growatt backend.

Current goals:
- Receive charger status (Idle / Charging / Faulted)
- Receive live power and energy data
- Start / stop charging (planned)
- Configure charger behaviour (planned)
- Enable AP mode when needed (planned)

This approach avoids fragile MITM proxies and cloud dependencies.

## Architecture (high level)

Growatt THOR EV Charger [OCPP 1.6 (WebSocket, unencrypted)] --> Home Assistant Growatt THOR custom integration with local OCPP server

The charger itself sends its **Charge Point ID automatically** as part of the WebSocket URL.

## Installation (via HACS)

### 1. Add the custom repository

1. Open **Home Assistant**
2. Go to **HACS → Integrations**
3. Click the **three dots (⋮)** → *Custom repositories*
4. Add:
   - **Repository**: `https://github.com/bobbesnl/growatt_thor`
   - **Category**: Integration
5. Click **Add**
6. Search for **Growatt THOR EV Charger**
7. Install the integration
8. Restart Home Assistant

---

### 2. Add the integration

After restart:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add integration**
3. Search for **Growatt THOR**
4. Choose a listening port (default: `9000`)
5. Finish setup

Home Assistant is now waiting for the charger to connect.

## Configure the Growatt THOR charger

⚠️ **Important:**
Changing the server URL may block access to the Growatt cloud and app.

In many cases (including mine), the **server URL can only be changed while the charger is in AP mode**. So double check
the server URL before saving!
On other (older?) versions of the Thor charger, settings can be changed via an internal Web interface which can mostly
be found at 192.168.1.5:8080 via a LAN cable connection (set a static IP on your PC eg 192.168.1.13)

### Typical steps (example)

1. Enable **AP Mode** on the Growatt THOR charger
2. Connect your phone to the charger's Wi-Fi access point
3. Open the **ShinePhone / Growatt app**
4. Go to charger network or server settings
5. Change the server URL to: ws://<HOME_ASSISTANT_IP>:9000/ocpp/ws

Example:
ws://192.168.1.101:9000/ocpp/ws


6. Save settings
7. Reboot the charger

If successful, Home Assistant will automatically detect the charger.

## Switching back to Growatt Cloud (important)

If something goes wrong and the charger no longer works as expected:

- You **must** restore the original Growatt server URL  
  (usually `ws://evcharge.growatt.com:80/ocpp/ws`)
- This often again requires **AP mode**

As a fallback, you can temporarily run a TCP forwarder (e.g. `socat`) on port 9000 to forward traffic back to Growatt:

install Advanced SSH & Web terminal add-on in Home Assistant. Start it and install socat:
apk add socat 

Then run socat:
/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:9000,fork,reuseaddr TCP:evcharge.growatt.com:80

If you get a warning about address and port in use, you need to remove the Thor EV ocpp integration and restart HA
